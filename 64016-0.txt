         EIGHT O’CLOCK


    Jeanette is not a sleepy-head;
      An easy task, to wake her!
    At eight o’clock she springs from bed--
      No need to call or shake her.
    Her brother Jean--I grieve to state--
      His patient _bonne_ distresses;
    ’Tis often nearer nine than eight
      Before at last he dresses.

    For _déjeuner_ our children eat
      A bowl of milk and bit of bread;
    Or sometimes, for a special treat,
      A _croissant_, crisp and fresh, instead.
    Jeanette displays her bringing up,
      For daintily she sips and lingers.
    Her brother drains his brimming cup,
      And then--oh, horror!--licks his fingers!

         TEN O’CLOCK


    At ten o’clock the teacher comes
    Bringing books and dreadful sums.
    Jeanette’s patience never fails,
    But Jean his lesson-time bewails.
    For boys have better things to do
    Than multiplying two by two!

         ELEVEN O’CLOCK


    The Luxembourg is a jolly place
    To roll your hoop, and to run a race
    With a gallant yacht, and win, of course,
    Or caper about on a mettled horse!
    And your heart is gay and your cheeks are bright--
    And home you go with an appetite!

[Illustration: ELEVEN O’CLOCK]




         TWELVE O’CLOCK


    Luncheon never comes too soon,
    For we are nearly starved at noon!
    Spinach and an omelette,
    Salad, too, and better yet
    Delicious jam with creamy cheese--
    A dish that’s very sure to please!
    Becoming gratitude they feel,
    And thank _le bon Dieu_ for their meal.

[Illustration: TWELVE O’CLOCK]




         THIRTEEN O’CLOCK


    Luncheon done,
    They nap at one;
    Truth to tell,
    The two rebel.
    Sleep was made for night, they say,
    And never for a sunny day!

         FOURTEEN O’CLOCK


    We think it quite a jolly lark
    To go a-riding in the park.
    Jeanette’s mount is safe and sure,
    Upon his back she sits secure.
    But Jean--another matter, quite!
    His steed is proud and full of fight.
    “_Oo-là-là!_” His _bonne_ cries out--
    “You’ll break your neck without a doubt!”

         FIFTEEN O’CLOCK


    Every perfect Frenchman’s heart
    Thrills in keen response to Art.
    Great his rapture when he sees a
    Venus or a Mona Lisa;
    And incomplete his education
    Lacking Art Appreciation.
    So our pair must learn to know
    Da Vinci, Titian and Corot.
    Their teacher knows the surest way:
    She takes them to the Louvre each day.

    Feet were made to dance on, truly;
    But Jean’s too often are unruly.
    Now a dip and now a slide--
    Watch the graceful Jeanette glide!
    High upon her tippy-toes,
    Light as gentlest breeze that blows.
    Now a slip and now a stumble--
    See her brother trip and tumble
        Flat upon his nose!

         SEVENTEEN O’CLOCK


    At five o’clock we take our tea;
     Lighted candles on the table.
    Sister dainty as can be,
      And Brother good as he is able.
    But he is generous through and through,
    And gives Minette a bite or two.

[Illustration: SEVENTEEN O’CLOCK]




         EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK


    After tea it’s very jolly
    To play with train and Mistress Dolly.
    Over mountains, under tunnels,
    Roaring flames and smoking funnels--
    Hear the engine clank and clatter!
    Drowning Jeanette’s quiet chatter
    As she hugs her dolly tight
    And makes her ready for the night.

[Illustration: EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK]




         NINETEEN O’CLOCK


    Life is not alone for fun;
    There are lessons to be done.
    But oh, how hard to concentrate
    On three from six and five times eight
    When there’s a train upon the floor,
    And bandits lurking by the door!

[Illustration: NINETEEN O’CLOCK]




         TWENTY O’CLOCK


    A day that’s filled with pleasant things
    Hastens by as if on wings.
    It seems you scarce have gotten up
    Before it’s time again to sup,
    And say your prayers, and go to bed,
    And dream of happiness ahead.
